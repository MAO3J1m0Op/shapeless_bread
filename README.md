# Shapeless Bread
## Shapeless recipes for wheat, paper and more!
Shapeless bread is a Minecraft Datapack that adds additional recipes to the game, allowing players to not need a crafting table to make the recipes. The current recipes included are:
 - Wheat
 - Paper

# Instructions for Usage
Shapeless Bread was tested in Minecraft Java Edtion 1.14.4. Currently, there are no ways to implement datapacks into bedrock edition, so this datapack is only compatible with Minecraft Java Edition.

To add to a world, simply open the world's saves folder, and place the included `shapeless_bread` folder in the world save's subfolder titled `datapacks`. If no such folder exists, create one and place the `shapeless_bread` folder in the created subfolder.
